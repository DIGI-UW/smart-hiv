* description = "A member of a key population is someone who, due to specific higher-risk behaviours, is at an increased risk of HIV irrespective of the epidemic type or local context. Key population groups also often have legal and social issues related to their behaviours that increase their vulnerability to HIV.\nFive key populations are included in this kit: (1) men who have sex with men, (2) people who inject drugs, (3) people in prisons and other closed settings, (4) sex workers and (5) transgender people. Key populations are important to the dynamics of HIV transmission and are essential partners in an effective response to the epidemic."
