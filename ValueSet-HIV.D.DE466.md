Value set of type of treatment-limiting toxicity experienced by client. Treatment-limiting toxicity is defined as a serious adverse drug reaction that results in drug discontinuation or substitution. In addition, any reaction that leads to treatment interruption or requires changing the drug or regimen because of an adverse drug reaction is also considered a serious adverse drug reaction.

 Explanation of the columns that may appear on this page: 

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| Level | A few code lists that FHIR defines are hierarchical - each code is assigned a level. In this scheme, some codes are under other codes, and imply that the code they are under also applies |
| System | The source of the definition of the code (when the value set draws in codes defined elsewhere) |
| Code | The code (used as the code in the resource instance) |
| Display | The display (used in the*display*element of a[Coding](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#Coding)). If there is no display, implementers should not simply display the code, but map the concept into their application |
| Definition | An explanation of the meaning of the concept |
| Comments | Additional notes about how to use the code |
